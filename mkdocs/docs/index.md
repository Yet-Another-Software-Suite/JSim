# JSim
JSim is a modular FRC physics library for simulation, analysis, and robotics workflow integration.

!!! info "Project Status"
    JSim is under active development. Core simulation features and additional capabilities are being added iteratively.

## Why JSim

- Unified physics engine for rigid-body, drivetrain, and mechanism simulation
- Multi-language support with native C++ and Python/Java bindings
- Simulation runtime components for robot code and sensor pipelines
- CAD import workflows for URDF, STL, and related geometry formats
- Modular architecture for custom models, forces, and plugins

## Project Goals

- Accuracy: physically grounded simulation for FRC robots and game elements
- Integration: seamless workflow from CAD to code to simulation
- Accessibility: practical for teams of varied experience levels
- Open source: community-driven and MIT-licensed

## Quick Start

### Build and Test

```bash
scripts/run-tests.sh
```

### Direct Gradle Workflow

```bash
cd vendordep
./gradlew test
```

`scripts/run-tests.sh` is the recommended path from repository root and expects Java 21.

### Run Examples

- C++: `examples/cpp/minimal_world.cpp`
- Python: `examples/python/simple_world_demo.py`
- Java: `examples/java/FlywheelPredictionExample.java`
